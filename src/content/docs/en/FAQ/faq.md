## Best usage

Set a strong password.

Keep your encrypted files together, so you can easily find them. This is very important when you want to change the password.
You can create a directiry, make a file as the index file, create other files use some simple chars as the filename. For example:

```
├── secret_directory
│   ├── 100.md.enc
│   ├── 101.md.enc
│   ├── 102.md.enc
│   ├── 200.md.enc
│   ├── 203.md.enc
│   └── 205.md.enc
```

You can make **200.md.enc** as the index file, edit some links to other files, like:

```
[ssh key](./100.md.enc)
[password](./101.md.enc)
[emails](./102.md.enc)
[bank](./203.md.enc)
[family](./205.md.enc)
```

## How to change password?

At first, the password has two usages, one is used to unlock the login screen, another one is used to encrypt the file.

So, if you want to change your password, you can follow the steps:

1. Export all of your encypted files.
2. Delete your app data, both configure files and user data.
3. Reopen your app, set a new password in the **setup wizard** page.
4. Copy your file contents into the new files.

## I can't edit file when sync service is not available.

Because to make a perfect sync service is not easy. so if you have set a sync service, all the changes will be sent to the remote server first, and the local file changes after the sync service returns success. This will ensure the files are correct.

## Can I work with git?

If you want to use **git** on desktop OS, it's better to usset the sync service, because **Initialize from remote end** will remove the **workDir**, this will lost **.git** directory.

For mobile OS, you cannot use **git**, set a sync service is necessary.
