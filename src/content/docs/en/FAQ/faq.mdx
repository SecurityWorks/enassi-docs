## Best usage

### Set a strong password.

Hide real file names
An encrypted file with a special name can be used as the index file, so that others cannot know the actual file name of the encrypted file. For example:

```
├── secret_directory
│   ├── 100.md.enc
│   ├── 101.md.enc
│   ├── 102.md.enc
│   ├── 200.md.enc
│   ├── 203.md.enc
│   └── 205.md.enc
```

You can make **200.md.enc** as the index file, edit some links to other files, like:

```
[ssh key](./100.md.enc)
[password](./101.md.enc)
[emails](./102.md.enc)
[bank](./203.md.enc)
[family](./205.md.enc)
```

## How to change password?

At first, the password has two usages, one is used to unlock the login screen, another one is used to encrypt the file.

So, if you want to change your password, you can follow the steps:

1. Export all of your encypted files.
2. Delete your app data, both configure files and user data.
3. Reopen your app, set a new password in the **setup wizard** page.
4. Create a new file with an encrypted file extension (defaults **.enc**), copy the file content to the new file, and save it.

## I can't edit file when sync service is not available.

Because to make a perfect sync service is not easy. so if you have set a sync service, all the changes will be sent to the remote server first, and the local file changes after the sync service returns success. This will ensure the files are correct.

## Why not use git synchronization?

If there is a file content conflict, it is more difficult for ordinary users to solve, in order to make it easier for ordinary users to use.

## Can I work with git?

If you want to use **git** or other version control tools for synchronization, you need to disable enassi synchronization because initialization from remote will delete the **~/enassi/user-files** directory, which will cause errors by deleting the **.git** directory.

- On Windows 10/11, we rely on Edge, currently render flags as letters, not flags.
