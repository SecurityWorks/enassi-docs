## Why is it recommended to use xrtm files?

The essence of xrtm files is HTML files. We have the following thoughts:
Although markdown has many advantages, such as simplicity, ease of learning, and readability, it also has some drawbacks:

- Compatibility issues:
  - Lack of unified standards: Without a unified standard, different implementations may support different extended syntax, and different parsers may have differences in parsing syntax.
  - Dialect issues:
    - There are many dialects, such as GitHub Flavored Markdown, GitLab Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, MultiMarkdown, Kramdown, and so on.
    - Even editors such as Obisidian and Typora will add special syntax.
- Not supporting complex styles: CSS styles are not supported, and for documents that require complex style control, markdown may not be sufficient.
- Learning curve: For users who are completely unfamiliar with markdown, there is a certain level of difficulty.

Compared to markdown, HTML is better in all aspects except for its more complex source code.
Especially HTML has a unified standard, there is no dialect issue, and any browser can render it normally.

We hope to use a standardized, plain text data format to store documents, maintaining data transparency and high usability.
We compared different formats such as markdown/JSON/TOML/HTML, and ultimately decided to use HTML.

Using the Fivim editor, quick input can be achieved using shortcut keys similar to Markdown.

## Can I not set a password?

No, the password set in the **setup wizard** has two purposes:

1. It will be used to encrypt your configuration files, protect your configuration, especially parameters used for synchronization.
2. It will be used to encrypt the file you specified, using the '. enc' extension by default.

## Best usage

### Set a strong password.

### Hide real file names

An encrypted file with a special name can be used as the index file, so that others cannot know the actual file name of the encrypted file. For example:

```
├── secret_directory
│   ├── 100.md.enc
│   ├── 101.md.enc
│   ├── 102.md.enc
│   ├── 200.md.enc
│   ├── 203.md.enc
│   └── 205.md.enc
```

You can make **200.md.enc** as the index file, edit some links to other files, like:

```
[ssh key](./100.md.enc)
[password](./101.md.enc)
[emails](./102.md.enc)
[bank](./203.md.enc)
[family](./205.md.enc)
```

## How to change password?

At first, the password has two usages, one is used to unlock the login screen, another one is used to encrypt the file.

So, if you want to change your password, you can follow the steps:

1. Export all of your encypted files.
2. Delete your app data, both configure files and user data.
3. Reopen your app, set a new password in the **setup wizard** page.
4. Create a new file with an encrypted file extension (defaults **.enc**), copy the file content to the new file, and save it.

## I can't edit file when sync service is not available.

Because to make a perfect sync service is not easy. so if you have set a sync service, all the changes will be sent to the remote server first, and the local file changes after the sync service returns success. This will ensure the files are correct.

## Why not use git synchronization?

If there is a file content conflict, it is more difficult for ordinary users to solve, in order to make it easier for ordinary users to use.

## Can I work with git?

If you want to use **git** or other version control tools for synchronization, you need to disable fivim synchronization because initialization from remote will delete the **~/fivim/user-files** directory, which will cause errors by deleting the **.git** directory.

## Windows 10/11 missing emoji flag support

On Windows 10/11, we rely on Edge, currently render flags as letters, not flags. [Learn more](https://github.com/nolanlawson/emoji-picker-element/issues/269)
