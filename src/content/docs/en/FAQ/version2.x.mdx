## Code for version 2. x

Almost rewritten, mainly including:

- Change rich text editor to [Jodit](https://xdsoft.net/jodit/)
- Change Vue to React
- Use rspack instead of vite (In order for Jodit to not report any errors after packaging)

### About Rich Text Editor

We have tried the following editors:

- [Jodit](https://xdsoft.net/jodit/) / [repo](https://github.com/xdan/jodit)
- [Lexical](https://lexical.dev/) / [repo](https://github.com/facebook/lexical)
- [Mdx editor](https://mdxeditor.dev/) / [repo](https://github.com/mdx-editor/editor)
- [Quill](https://quilljs.com/) / [repo](https://github.com/quilljs/quill)

In the end, we decided to use [Jodit](https://xdsoft.net/jodit/). Because of its rich functionality, easy scalability, and ability to save as HTML (with strong versatility and smaller data volume).

## Features of version 2. x

Functionality has been adjusted:

- After removing the file safe, you can use **Import files and encrypt it** to achieve the same function.
- Temporarily removed sharing with friends

## Migration from version 1. x

Due to significant differences, it is necessary to copy each file from version 1.x one by one to version 2.x.
