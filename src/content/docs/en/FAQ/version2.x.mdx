## Code for version 2. x

Almost rewritten, mainly including:

- Change rich text editor to our **exsied**
- Change Vue to React

### About Rich Text Editor

We have tried the following editors:

- [editor.js](https://github.com/codex-team/editor.js)
- [Jodit](https://github.com/xdan/jodit)
- [Lexical](https://github.com/facebook/lexical)
- [Mdx editor](https://github.com/mdx-editor/editor)
- [Quill](https://github.com/quilljs/quill)

We hope to use HTML to save user data because HTML is highly versatile and has a smaller amount of data.

In the end, we decided to create a new esitor called **exsied**, [Github repo](https://github.com/exsied/exsied) / [Gitee repo](https://githee.com/exsied/exsied) / [Document](https://enassi.pages.dev/en/exsied/about/).

## Features of version 2. x

Functionality has been adjusted:

- After removing the file safe, you can use **Import files and encrypt it** to achieve the same function.
- Temporarily removed sharing with friends

## Migration from version 1. x

Due to significant differences, it is necessary to copy each file from version 1.x one by one to version 2.x.
