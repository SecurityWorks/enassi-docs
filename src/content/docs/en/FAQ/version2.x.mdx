## Code for version 2. x

Almost rewritten, mainly including:

- Change rich text editor to [Jodit](https://github.com/xdan/jodit)
- Change Vue to React
- Use rspack instead of vite (In order for Jodit to not report any errors after packaging)

## Features of version 2. x

Functionality has been adjusted:

- After removing the file safe, you can use **Import files and encrypt it** to achieve the same function.
- Temporarily removed sharing with friends

## Migration from version 1. x

Due to significant differences, it is necessary to copy each file from version 1.x one by one to version 2.x.
