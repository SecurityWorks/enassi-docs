## Setup wizard

- Choose a theme
- Set password, which will be used for file encryption (including configuration files and user requested encrypted files) and unlocking login interface
- Set the extension of the encrypted file, defaults **.enc**.

## File types

Supports Markdown files (.md), Rich Text files (.xrtm), PDFs, images, etc.

### Rich Text files

We use '.xrtm' as the extension for rich text files, which is essentially HTML code with strong universality and facilitates data migration

#### Hot key

The shortcut keys we support are as follows:

- Heading 1:**#**
- Heading 2:**##**
- Heading 3:**###**
- Heading 4:**####**
- Heading 5:**#####**
- Heading 6:**######**
- Italic:**\***
- Bold:**\*\***
- Line:**\*\*\***
- Image:**\\[[**
- Link:**\\[**
- Ordered list: **1.**
- Unordered list:**-**
- Qoute:**>**
- Table:**|||**
- Code block:**```**

Usage: Press the shortcut key in the new block, then press **shift + space** to trigger the shortcut function

## Sync

Currently supports **Gitee** and **Gitlab**. If synchronization is enabled, file changes will first modify remote files before modifying local files.

The token needs to be obtained by the user on the Gitee and Gitlab pages:

[gitee's token](https://gitee.com/profile/personal_access_tokens/new) At least check the Permission **projects**.

[gitlab's token](https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/personal_access_tokens) At least check the Scopes **api, read_api, read_repository, write_repository**.

## Configuration file

Enassi has two configuration files located in the **enassi** directory in your document directory:

- **conf/conf. bin** is the main configuration file, and its content will be encrypted.
- **conf/conf. startup. json** is the configuration file for launching the app, and its content is json

The specific path for **conf/conf.bin** is:

- Windows: `C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\Documents\enassi\conf.bin`
- Linux: `~/Documents/enassi/conf/conf.bin`
- MacOS: `~/Documents/enassi/conf/conf.bin`
